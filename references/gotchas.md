# Matillion → Databricks migration gotchas

Read before translating any component. Grows as new issues surface.

## `[Environment Default]` catalog/schema placeholders

Matillion resolves `catalog: "[Environment Default]"` / `schema: "[Environment Default]"` from its environment config at runtime. Databricks has no equivalent — you must substitute a real UC 3-layer namespace (`catalog.schema.table`).

Watch for inconsistency: in the samples, `sales-by-category-region.tran.yaml` uses `[Environment Default]` while the `python-script` in `create-maia-demo-data.orch.yaml` hardcodes `marcin_demo.default`. Pick one target catalog/schema and apply it everywhere (ideally as a bundle variable).

## Seed data in `sql-executor` is not a transformation

`CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ... INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)` blocks are demo/fixture data. Keep them as a Job setup SQL task. Do **not** model them as Lakeflow pipeline tables — the pipeline should read them as sources, not own them.

## `python-script` uses Matillion-runtime APIs

`context`, `context.cursor()`, `subprocess`, `interpreter: "Python 3"`, `user: "Privileged"` exist only in Matillion. Extract the real payload (usually embedded SQL) and run it via `spark.sql(...)` or a SQL task. Discard the plumbing.

## Backticked identifiers & aliases carry over

Matillion `joinExpressions` predicates (e.g. `` `s`.`product_id` = `p`.`product_id` ``) are already valid Spark SQL. Copy verbatim. Preserve the `mainTableAlias` and per-join aliases — `columnMappings` depend on them.

## Preserve explicit column projections

`table-input.columnNames` and `join.columnMappings` are explicit whitelists. Do not replace with `SELECT *` — downstream steps and the final target schema depend on the exact columns and order.

## Rewrite ≠ append

`rewrite-table-dl` means full overwrite each run. Map to a materialized view (full refresh) or `CREATE OR REPLACE`, never `INSERT INTO` (which appends).
